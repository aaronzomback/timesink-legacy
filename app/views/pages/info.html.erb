    <h3>Review guidelines</h3>
    <div class="answer"><p>We believe the best way to create value for everyone is to promote honesty above anything else. Bringing back the art of critique and debate is one of our goals. </p> <p> So we want your candid thoughts, but we expect them to be expressd through great taste and style.</p>  <p> Any reviews that become personal attacks or deemed 'poor taste' by our editors will be removed. </p></div>

    <h3>Film submissions</h3>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>We accept digital film submissions from around the globe for a fee of $10 each. </p> <p> Each submission comes with our guaranteed proof-of-viewership, followed by a written response. Filmmakers can also track the status of their submission throughout the process. </p> <p> We don't distinguish between genres, duration, or release year. If your film exceeds our standards then we will present it! <p> As Nietschze once wrote, "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger," so please don't be discouraged if your film is not selected - keep trying! </p>

In the near future, we plan on rolling out prizes for members who achieve a certain amount of upvotes on their activity (reviews and comments). </p>
